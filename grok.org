#+TITLE: Grok

* baby steps
emacs is admirable piece of software.
i want to know what makes it tick.
this is what i do: see a feature and ask /how'd they do that?/
like any other work, to read, you need tools.
the idea is too find in code what you see on screen.
the default state of code is *incomprehensible.*
comprehension happens in iterations.
** questions
- where is the entry point?
- do any of the global vars map to features?
** foresight
- production code has tests and error handling
