#+TITLE: Git

* Version Control System
** why do i need one?
you need a tool that operates at the project level.
with a vcs, you can see
- timeline -> (what led to this?)
- spinoff  -> (how do i build something else on this?)
- merge    -> (how do i integrate my independent work on the project into the main project?)

if you're taking snapshots of your work, these must be fast:
- snapshotting(committing)
- switching to branches or commits
you can see you need good software to do that.
because commits and branches can be traversed, git prevents you from doing any permanent damage.
** how does it work?
well, you have commits and branches.
commits are snapshots on a timeline.
branches create a new timeline with a shared history.
